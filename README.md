# Build an Instagram Clone in React

## A repo of Scrimba's Instagram Clone course which uses React, Firebase and Tailwind

This repo is for anyone who wants to work on the course outside of Scrimba's environment in their own editor of choice.

What I've done is created the project using [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/), locally installed all of the dependencies used
in the course and made any necessary adjustments to have it work in a local environment which includes some additional steps to make Tailwind
work with create-react-app. Read more here: [Installing Tailwind with Create React App](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app)

## Instructions

1. In order to use this repo, simply clone or download a copy of it to your machine.
2. Open a terminal in the root directory and run: npm install
3. Make sure you have an '.env' file in the root directory. Copy from '.env.sample' and replace with your API parameters from your firebase store.
4. Make sure that you have a .gitignore file with .env listed so that your API keys aren't exposed publicly if you are keeping it in a public repo.
5. To run, open a terminal and type: npm start
